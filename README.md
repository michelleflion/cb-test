# Wallet API v2 - App Walkthtough

## Overview 
The Wallet API v2 allows you to create account and perform operations on EVM compatible networks.

In this example, you will utilize Wallet API v2 through Python CDP SDK, a library that provides a client for interacting with the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), to build a simple CLI-based app with multiple functionalities on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) .

Through this example, you will learn how to:

1. Generate EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) on EVM
2. Generate Smart Contract wallets on EVM
3. Fund the Smart Contract wallet created with Sepolia Ethereum (ETH) using the Coinbase faucet
4. Transfer the ETH funded above to a different EVM wallet of choice
